                            <li> For example, given a well with high tortuosity and various problematic areas,we want to get a better depth resolution of these areas. </li>
                            <li> For this, we use advanced signal processing techniques to deconvolve the given data to pin point the dysfunction along a borehole. </li>

                <p>
                    I was a professional speed skater for 15 years,and a Indian team member for ten years. I have won multiple national and international medals.
                    <br/><br/>
                    I am also an ardent trekker. I have trekked to Everest Base Camp, Dafey bhir in the Himalayas, and many
                    smaller treks in and around Karnataka and the Rockies.
